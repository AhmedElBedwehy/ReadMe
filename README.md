Hi, I’m Ahmed and welcome to my Github Profile. I’m currently a project/product manager at a tech startup, I’ve been working in tech for about 3 years. I also worked as a software developer previously. I’m interested in a digital marketing role as it reflects my own passion which is impacting people and making their lives better through carefully designed products and services.

In my current role, my responsibility is to make sure our product is highly relevant to the user and make an impact for them. I also am the facilitator between my team and the stakeholders where I receive the business requirements and communicate them to the development team. I am a strong communicator with a sense of leadership and creativity as well as an eye for the little details. I utilized these skills to help my team build a new version of our app which ended up doubling our user base, I am also taking a Nano-degree in cloud development and trying to take my user-centric approach to development in the cloud.

I am inspired to make an impact on organizations and individuals by taking my user-centric approach to digital marketing and development in the cloud.
